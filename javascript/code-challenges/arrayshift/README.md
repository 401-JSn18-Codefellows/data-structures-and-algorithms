# Challenge Summary

Take and array and a value.
Create a function that takes them both in, and places the value in the middle index of that array, return the array.

## Challenge Description

The function finds the middle by taking the value of the array's lenghth -1, then dividing it by two to get the diference. Then, we are using to math.ceil() to get a whole number.
The placeholder value 'index' is then set to that number.
We used splice to place the number in the variable 'value' into the index stored in the variable 'index'.
Return the array.
